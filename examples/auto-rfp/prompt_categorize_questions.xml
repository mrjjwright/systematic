<categorize_description>

give me the question that is most like the one I provide in your answer xml block with structure <best><question></question></best>

where <best></best> is just a wrapper to tell me this is the pair that you think best matches the original question

and inside <question></question> you should put the exact text of the question from the lookup pairs.

if there are 1-3 others that are close mention them as well inside an <additional blendRatio="0.3"><pair></pair></additional> block

if you do indeed provide additional question/answer pairs, give a blendRatio on a scale of 0-1

where 0.9 is very heavily blended

meaning that all supplied question answers should be heavily blended

and 0.1 means a very light touch of additional answers can be found in the additional supplied question and answer pairs
