#### Introduction

The explainPaths<Topic>.txt format is a straightforward method for documenting the structure and interconnections of a particular part, subsystem, contribution of a larger contextual url based system, like a filesytem, or antying with paths, like the intnet. Each entry consists of a comment followed by a URI. The comments provide context and describe the role of each file, aiding in understanding the architecture and relationships within the project. This format is typically used within the context of a Git repository or a similar significant collection of files. It serves as a guide for developers and intelligent systems, offering a mental map of the codebase without requiring a deep dive into every file. While currently simple and primarily for human comprehension, the format has the potential for future expansion to support more complex analysis and documentation needs. Contributors are encouraged to maintain clarity and consistency in their comments to ensure the format remains useful and informative.

The goal is for this format to serve as an outline/path to a particular contextual problem, where the uris are simple paths are other supported kind of urls and ways to reference things, particulary inside vscode.

#### Format

The file is made up of entries.

An entry is defined as 2 or more lines where exactly one line is the relative path to the file and one more preceding lines are comments about it.

There should be at least one line describing what it does and no excessive explanations are needed unleess more lines are truly needed to just explain the purpose of the file
