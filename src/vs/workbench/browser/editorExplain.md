# VSCode Editor System

The editor system provides VSCode's core content editing capabilities through a flexible, extensible architecture.

## Core Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| EditorInput | Content source abstraction |
| EditorPane | UI container for editors |
| GridView | Layout engine for editor groups |
| EditorGroup | Container managing multiple editors |

## Key Mechanics

The editor system manages content through layers of abstraction:

1. EditorInput represents content source (file, diff, untitled, etc)
2. EditorPane renders content in the UI with editing capabilities
3. EditorGroup organizes multiple editors in a container
4. GridView arranges editor groups in configurable layouts

This separation allows VSCode to:
- Handle any content type uniformly
- Support different editor implementations
- Enable flexible window layouts
- Maintain editor state

## Grid Integration

Editor groups slot into GridView's tree structure:
